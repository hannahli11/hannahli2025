       <br> <h2 style="color:Purple;">My Journey</h2>
    <p>The main problems I had throughout this journey was mainly getting everything to work. I had a hard time with the set up because a lot of the times the terminal or vscode wouldn't let me so I had to somehow figure out how to fix it. Sometimes the codes to setup wouldn't work so I either had to redo everything or reread all the instructions and fix whatever mistakes I made in between.</p>
