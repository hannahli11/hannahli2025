    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `index.md`: This is the source file for the home page of the project. It is a standard file for all GitHub Pages projects. Note that Markdown (.md) files are converted to HTML by the Jekyll build process. HTML files are the only file type that is rendered on a website.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `_notebooks`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files. These files are converted to Markdown (.md) files by the Makefile rules in the build process. The Markdown files are then converted to HTML by the Jekyll build process.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `_posts`: This directory contains Markdown (.md) files that will be part of the website. These files are formatted similarly to index.md and include frontmatter (metadata coded in YAML) and Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS source code. You will also find Liquid code in these files, which is used to generate Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `_config.yml`: This file contains YAML definitions (key-value properties) used to build the Jekyll website.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `.gitignore`: This file specifies elements to be excluded from version control. Files are excluded when they are derived from the original source and not considered part of the project's source code. In the VSCode Explorer, you may notice some files appearing dimmed, indicating that they are purposely excluded by the rules in .gitignore.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `layouts`: This directory contains HTML files used by Jekyll to generate the structure of the website, including blogs, schedules, and home pages. Each post or notebook specifies a layout in its frontmatter, which determines how the content is presented.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `scripts`: This directory contains scripts such as `convert_notebooks.py`, which converts Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files into Markdown (.md) files. These scripts automate parts of the build process, ensuring that content is properly formatted for the website.\\n\",\n",
