    "- Ensured all team members‚Äô features could efficiently interact with the database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Deployment**  \n",
    "- Assisted in modifying frontend code to ensure successful deployment.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **5. Frontend-Backend Integration**  \n",
    "- Supported team members in integrating frontend and backend systems for seamless communication.  \n",
    "- Ensured API endpoints were correctly implemented and functioning as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CPT requirement highlights: \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Instructions for Input**\n",
    "- Users enter their **name, username, and favorite artists** through a form, which triggers a **POST request** to the backend.  \n",
    "<span style=\"color: red;\">UPDATED</span> Name, username, and favorite artist is gathered and prepared to send backend as a POST request\n",
    "<br><img alt=\"domextract\" src=\"/hannahli2025/images/domextract.png\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Use of a List (or Collection)**\n",
    "- The backend stores **artist recommendations in a dictionary of lists**, allowing for **efficient retrieval and updates**.  \n",
    "<br><img alt=\"list\" src=\"/hannahli2025/images/list.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color: red;\">UPDATED</span> The database table functions as a structured collection of records, storing and organizing user information efficiently. Each record (row) represents an individual user, while fields (columns) store specific attributes such as name, username, and favorite artists. \n",

    "\n",
    "### **4. Algorithm with Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **5. Calls to Student-Developed Procedure**\n",
    "- `loadUsers()` is called **on page load** and **after user actions** (adding, updating, deleting users).  \n",
    "- This ensures that **data remains updated without requiring a manual refresh**.\n",

    "- Using Data from the List: In the get() method, the data in recommended_artists is used by adding it to the response, showing how the list is dynamically populated and returned as part of the final output. Each user's favorites is passed to the get_recommended_artists() method, and the resulting list is displayed as part of their data.\n",

    "### **1. Program Design, Function, and Purpose**\n",
    "- The expected user of Melody Mates is a music enthusiast who wants to connect with others who share similar tastes in music. One way the program's design meets the needs of this user is by providing artist recommendations based on the user‚Äôs preferred artists. This feature helps users discover new artists tailored to their musical preferences, enhancing their experience by making the platform more personalized and engaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Algorithm Development**\n",
    "- The loop will run a number of times equal to the length of the all_artists list. There is no condition in the current implementation that would cause an infinite loop, as the loop iterates through a fixed list, and the body of the loop is designed to terminate after checking each artist. However, if the iteration was incorrectly structured with a while loop that fails to update or reduce the list, such as not removing processed artists, it could lead to an infinite loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Errors and Testing**\n",
    "- A run-time error would be modifying the condition if artist not in user_favorite_artists: to if artist in user_favorite_artists:. This would cause the procedure to incorrectly add artists that the user has already favorited to the recommendation list. If further operations depend on this condition, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors, such as trying to add a favorite artist multiple times, causing potential issues in other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Data and Procedural Abstraction**\n",
    "- Initialize a counter variable count to 0. Then, iterate through the list of recommended artists. For each artist in the list, use the isEqual procedure to compare the current artist to the target artist. If isEqual returns true, increment the counter. After going through the entire list, return the counter value, which will give the number of times the target artist appears in the list of recommended artists."

    "- Q11. A is correct as the binary number‚Äá11111111‚Äáis equal to 255 as each 1 is two to the power of its number placement in the binary number starting from zero left to right . So he binary number‚Äá11110000‚Äáis equal to 240. Therefore, the given binary triplet represents the color ivory. Light yellow binary RBG triplet by math should be (11111111, 11111111, 11100000)\n",
    "- Q23. D is correct as the algorithm in the flowchart requires both conditions to be‚Äátrue‚Äáin order to set‚Äáavailable‚Äáto‚Äátrue. C is incorrect as both conditions need to be tru in order to set available to true\n",
    "- Q29. A is correct as Losssless compression is a technique that allows for complete reconstruction of the original data. B is an example of lossy audio compression where the file is compressed and transmitted.\n",
    "- Q39. C is correct as the program does not include the first element of the list in the sum because‚Äái‚Äáis incremented before‚Äánums[i]‚Äáis added to‚Äásum. By interchanging these two lines of code, the program will include all of the first ten elements of the list when computing the sum. Answer B doesn't fix the problem but only terminate the program at 10. \n",
    "- Q40. D is correct as Certificate authorities are entities that issue digital certificates, which are used to certify the ownership of public keys. C is incorrect as domain names into IP addresses uses domain system which isn't performed by certificate authorities.\n",
    "- Q43. C is correct as tt is possible to have redundant routing in both configurations. In configuration I, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-P-V, Q-T-V, and Q-R-S-V. In configuration II, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-S-V, Q-R-T-V, and Q-P-T-V. Redundant routing is configuration that has multiple paths so that if one route fails, data can still reach its destination through other routes. \n",
    "- Q47. C is correct because in order for a binary search on a list to work as intended, the list must be sorted. Even if it has duplicate values the binary search will work on any sorted list.\n",
    "- Q50. D is correct, For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements \n",
    " 2n times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses n to the power of two elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, which is considered reasonable time.\n",
    " - Q51. A is correct, Creative Commons licensing allows copyright owners to specify the ways in which their works can be used or distributed. This allows individuals to access or modify these works without the risk of violating copyright laws.\n",
    " - Q59. C is correct, Open-source software has source code that is released under a license that allows users the rights to use and distribute it. However, there is no guarantee that the original developer of open-source software will provide support for its users. B isn't correct as it allows developers to customize the source code to their needs\n",
    " - Q67. A and B are correct, For B code segment,‚Äácount‚Äáis increased to‚Äá1‚Äáthe first time‚Äá\"maple\"‚Äáis encountered in the list. However,‚Äácount‚Äáis reset to‚Äá0‚Äáwhen the code segment moves to the next list element. This causes the procedure to return‚Äá0‚Äáinstead of the intended result‚Äá1.\n",
