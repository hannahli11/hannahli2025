    "## Artist Recommendation Feature \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The Artist Recommendation Feature allows users to receive personalized music artist recommendations based on their input. When a user specifies their favorite artist, the system processes this input and returns a list of suggested artists that align with the user‚Äôs musical preferences. The user also has the ability to update their favorite artist, which dynamically adjusts the recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Functionality and Implementation**  \n",
    "- The feature takes user input, specifically their favorite artist, as a parameter.  \n",
    "- It retrieves a pre-existing list of recommended artists associated with the input artist.  \n",
    "- The system ensures that previously favorited artists (stored separately) are not recommended again.  \n",
    "- Users can modify their favorite artist, triggering an update in the recommendation list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Abstraction and Algorithms**  \n",
    "- The recommendation process is abstracted by storing related artists in a predefined list.  \n",
    "- When a user inputs their favorite artist, the system retrieves a corresponding list of recommended artists.  \n",
    "- A filtering step is applied to remove any artists the user has already favorited.  \n",
    "- If the user changes their favorite artist, a new list is retrieved, ensuring updated recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This feature enhances user engagement by providing dynamic and personalized artist suggestions while maintaining flexibility for user input adjustments.  \n",

    "## MCQ Corrections\n",
    "- Q11. A is correct as the binary number‚Äá11111111‚Äáis equal to 255 as each 1 is two to the power of its number placement in the binary number starting from zero left to right . So he binary number‚Äá11110000‚Äáis equal to 240. Therefore, the given binary triplet represents the color ivory. Light yellow binary RBG triplet by math should be (11111111, 11111111, 11100000)\n",
    "- Q23. D is correct as the algorithm in the flowchart requires both conditions to be‚Äátrue‚Äáin order to set‚Äáavailable‚Äáto‚Äátrue. C is incorrect as both conditions need to be tru in order to set available to true\n",
    "- Q29. A is correct as Losssless compression is a technique that allows for complete reconstruction of the original data. B is an example of lossy audio compression where the file is compressed and transmitted.\n",
    "- Q39. C is correct as the program does not include the first element of the list in the sum because‚Äái‚Äáis incremented before‚Äánums[i]‚Äáis added to‚Äásum. By interchanging these two lines of code, the program will include all of the first ten elements of the list when computing the sum. Answer B doesn't fix the problem but only terminate the program at 10. \n",
    "- Q40. D is correct as Certificate authorities are entities that issue digital certificates, which are used to certify the ownership of public keys. C is incorrect as domain names into IP addresses uses domain system which isn't performed by certificate authorities.\n",
    "- Q43. C is correct as tt is possible to have redundant routing in both configurations. In configuration I, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-P-V, Q-T-V, and Q-R-S-V. In configuration II, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-S-V, Q-R-T-V, and Q-P-T-V. Redundant routing is configuration that has multiple paths so that if one route fails, data can still reach its destination through other routes. \n",
    "- Q47. C is correct because in order for a binary search on a list to work as intended, the list must be sorted. Even if it has duplicate values the binary search will work on any sorted list.\n",
    "- Q50. D is correct, For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements \n",
    " 2n times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses n to the power of two elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, which is considered reasonable time.\n",
    " - Q51. A is correct, Creative Commons licensing allows copyright owners to specify the ways in which their works can be used or distributed. This allows individuals to access or modify these works without the risk of violating copyright laws.\n",
    " - Q59. C is correct, Open-source software has source code that is released under a license that allows users the rights to use and distribute it. However, there is no guarantee that the original developer of open-source software will provide support for its users. B isn't correct as it allows developers to customize the source code to their needs\n",
    " - Q67. A and B are correct, For B code segment,‚Äácount‚Äáis increased to‚Äá1‚Äáthe first time‚Äá\"maple\"‚Äáis encountered in the list. However,‚Äácount‚Äáis reset to‚Äá0‚Äáwhen the code segment moves to the next list element. This causes the procedure to return‚Äá0‚Äáinstead of the intended result‚Äá1.\n",
