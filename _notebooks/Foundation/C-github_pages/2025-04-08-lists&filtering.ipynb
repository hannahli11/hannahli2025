    "# Review Questions\n",
    "1. Lists are ordered collections that can hold elements of any data type. They are defined using square brackets [] and allow for easy access, modification, and manipulation of elements. In lists you can add, remove, or change items, and indexed, meaning each element has a specific position starting from 0. You can modify lists using various methods like append() to add an item, insert() to add at a specific index, and remove() to delete an item. Lists can also be accessed via indexing and slicing to retrieve specific elements or ranges. You can loop through lists with a for loop and use list comprehensions to create or modify lists in a concise way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A real-world scenario for a filtering algorithm might be in an e-commerce website, where you filter products based on price range, category, and rating. For example, a filter might display only items priced between $20 and $100 with a rating of 4 stars or higher, improving the user’s shopping experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analyzing the efficiency of filtering algorithms is important for performance and scalability. Inefficient algorithms can slow down applications, especially when dealing with large datasets. They also affect resource usage, potentially increasing costs. An optimized filtering algorithm enhances user experience by providing faster results and ensures the system remains responsive under load."
