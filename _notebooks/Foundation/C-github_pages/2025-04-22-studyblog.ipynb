    "## Binary Search Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: Efficiently search in a sorted list.\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "  1. Check the middle element.\n",
    "  2. If target < middle, search the left half.\n",
    "  3. If target > middle, search the right half.\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(log n)\n",
    "- Important: Only works on sorted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists and Filtering Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists: Ordered collection of items (e.g., [10, 20, 30]).\n",
    "- Filtering: Select items based on a condition.\n",
    "  - Example: `scores = [92, 85, 70]` → filter `score > 80` → `[92, 85]`\n",
    "- Common Uses:\n",
    "  - Sorting data\n",
    "  - Searching by criteria\n",
    "  - Removing duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation/Games and Random Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulation: Model real-world systems (e.g., weather, disease spread).\n",
    "- Games: Use randomness for fun or challenge.\n",
    "- Random Algorithms:\n",
    "  - Example: Monte Carlo simulation (random trials to estimate outcomes).\n",
