    "# Open Coding Society Biotech Video Game\n",
    "\n",
    "I contributed to designing and developing an engaging, interactive educational game that helps users learn about DNA base pairing and key concepts in biotechnology. The gameplay is inspired by Tetris as players must accurately complete single DNA base pairs on a moving strand before it scrolls off the screen. If players lose all three lives, they are prompted to answer biology trivia questions focused on biology used in biotech, reinforcing learning through challenge.\n",
    "The game includes several advanced features to enhance user experience and learning outcomes, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A real-time leaderboard to track high scores and encourage replayability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjustable difficulty through strand speed settings\n",
    "\n",
    "- A predictive health feature that uses user input (e.g., body metrics) to assess risk of heart disease and stroke, introducing players to practical applications of biotech and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project combines game design, educational content, and real-world health relevance to integrate STEM knowledge, coding skills, and user-centered design into one cohesive learning tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- I focused on enhancing the user interface and improving overall functionality. This included refining visual elements for a cleaner look, fixing small bugs, improving responsiveness, and optimizing Tailwind CSS templates. I also updated the navigation bar design to create a smoother and more user-friendly experience.\n",
