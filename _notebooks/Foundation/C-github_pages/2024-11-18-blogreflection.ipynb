    "## What I learned from the Quiz\n",
    "I learned and was familiar with the pogramming concepts like boolean, loops, conditionals...etc. I also gained insight into protocols like IPv4 which I have never seen before. Most of the questions helped strengthen my logical thinking and I learned some problem-solving skills through the questions that had me analyze the algorithm by figuring out what goes in the missing code."

    "## Which Type of Questions I Feel Weak On\n",
    "I think the questions I struggled the most on were the ones where I had to figure out what goes in the missing code or spotting errors in the code. Protocols were definitely the most difficult because most of them I have never heard before and I don't know what they are. Some of the questions about security is ethics were also a little challenging as the answers all seemed convincing. "

    "\n",
    "- Q14. C is correct answer as the display code for Program A and B are at different lines therefore the values differ\n",
    "- Q21. B is correct the robot must rotate right 3 times in order to face the gray square\n",
    "- Q26. A is correct as it rotates the robot right whenever there is an open square to the right\n",
    "- Q29. A is correct as both the first gates will produce an output of false so the circuit will also be false\n",
    "- Q31. C is correct as the first program makes the robot rotate left or right not move left or right\n",
    "- Q37. C is correct as the code for segment one has the arithmetic operation inside the loop not outside for it to be performed only once\n",
    "- Q42. two to the power of 128 divided by two to the power of 32 is two to the power of 96\n",
    "- Q43. A is correct as the number of steps of the algorithm is polynomial so it runs in reasonable time\n",
    "- Q44. B is correct with 4 bit integer representation only numbers 0-15 can be represented so anything above will result in overflow error\n",
    "- Q45. C is correct NOT(P AND Q) will result in it being false when both P and Q are true\n",
    "- Q46. D is correct as an undecidable program is when no algorithm can constructed that leads to a correct yes or no answer\n",
    "- Q47. D is correct because in public cryptography it is always decrypted with the recipient's private key\n",
    "- Q48. D is correct as it produces a result from 1 to 75 which is 75% of the time\n",
    "- Q50. B is correct as the procedure is linear search as it sequentially compares each element of the list with the target\n",
    "- Q51. B is correct as the secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of the message\n",
    "- Q55. D is correct becuase user can't put both y and yes so it will always be false\n",
    "- Q56. D is correct as it counts by odd integer and the loop iterates 10 times\n",
    "- Q60. Replacing repeated code with a call to a procedure makes it easier for a programmer\n",
    "- Q65.  "
