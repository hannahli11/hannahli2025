    "## Tips During the Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Read Instructions Carefully\n",
    "- Take time to read the instructions to ensure you understand what's expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Time Management\n",
    "- **Multiple-Choice**: Don’t spend too long on one question, move on and come back later if needed. Aim for 1 minute per question.\n",
    "- **Free-Response**: Plan your answers before writing and leave time for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use Scratch Paper\n",
    "- Jot down ideas or work through problems to stay organized and avoid mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Stay Calm and Focused\n",
    "- Breathe and stay positive. Focus on one question at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Answer All Questions\n",
    "- Don’t leave questions blank, even if unsure. Guess if necessary since there’s no penalty for wrong answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Free-Response Questions\n",
    "- **Follow Structure**: Use pseudocode, explanations, and clear steps.\n",
    "- **Write Legibly**: Make sure your answers are easy to follow.\n",
    "- **Be Concise**: Answer fully but avoid unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Explain Your Reasoning\n",
    "- In free-response, explain why you’re doing something, not just what.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Don’t Overthink\n",
    "- If stuck, move on and come back later. Sometimes answers come after a break.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Eliminate Obvious Wrong Answers\n",
    "- For multiple-choice, rule out obviously incorrect answers to improve guessing odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Use Your Knowledge of Algorithms\n",
    "- Use algorithms like binary search and sorting, and explain their purpose clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Review the Free-Response Questions Last\n",
    "- Complete multiple-choice first, then focus on free-response. Check your work if time allows.\n"

    "## Tips Before the Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Start Early\n",
    "- Begin studying well in advance to avoid last-minute cramming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Focus on Key Concepts\n",
    "- Prioritize understanding major topics: algorithms, data structures, abstraction, and digital divide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Practice with Past Exams\n",
    "- Work through past multiple-choice and free-response questions to get a feel for the exam format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Review the Rubric\n",
    "- Understand the grading rubric for the free-response section to know what to focus on in your answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Set a Study Schedule\n",
    "- Break down your study time by topic, making sure to allocate extra time for tough areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Use Study Groups\n",
    "- Join or form study groups to discuss difficult topics and share insights.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Active Recall\n",
    "- Test yourself regularly on key terms and concepts to strengthen memory retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Practice Coding\n",
    "- Write out code examples and algorithms by hand to reinforce your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use Flashcards\n",
    "- Create flashcards for important terms and definitions (e.g., Big O notation, algorithms, bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Focus on Weak Areas\n",
    "- Spend more time on topics you're less confident about, such as simulation or crowdsourcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Take Breaks\n",
    "- Don’t overload your brain. Study in short, focused bursts with breaks in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Stay Organized\n",
    "- Keep your notes and resources neatly organized to easily access materials when needed.\n"
