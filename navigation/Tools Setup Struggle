title: Tools Setup Struggle
permalink: /about/
---

I mainly struggled with getting the codes for tools setup to work on my computer as everytime I put it in there it always would not work when I entered it. I had to ask for help from friends and online on how to fix my problem, luckily, it was good enough to help me figure out how to fix it and I am able to get everything to work. A lot of it was trial and error but I was eventually able to code everything to work. Considering I have never coded with python before or had any intensive code experience, I'd say I was able to solve my issues well when things weren't working.
